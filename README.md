Blackjack-in-Java
=================

This Java application is made for playing Blackjack. 
Although it is intended to mimicking the real game, it is made under following assumptions:
1. The dealer has infinite amounts of chips. 
2. Cards are drawn randomly from multiple decks. 
3. The player can continue to play only when he/she has at least 1 chips in hand. 
4. Advanced actions such as splitting or doubling are not implemeted.
